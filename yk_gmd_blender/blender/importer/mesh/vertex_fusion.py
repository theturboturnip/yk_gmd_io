"""
This module handles vertex fusion - the process of deciding which vertices in a vertex buffer
are logically equivalent and can be "fused" into a single vertex without losing data.

## Motivation
The GMD file format is optimized for rendering, not content authoring.
As such, a single logical mesh/material pair can be split into many submeshes, with vertices duplicated between them,
where it is required (e.g. mesh/material pairs with >65535 vertices are split up because index buffers are 16-bit).
Additionally, many vertices may be duplicated for the sake of per-face data.
For example, a simple textured cylinder will have duplicated vertices at the texture seam, one with UV = 0 and another
with UV = 1.
For rendering this has no effect, any vertices with identical positions and normals will be look like they are
exactly the same vertex, but in Blender this causes issues.

Blender automatically calculates vertex normals based on what other vertices it is connected to, instead of letting 
users set normals manually. (You can try to use Split Normals, but I have not had good luck with this feature and 
it seems difficult to hand-author them from the Blender GUI.)
This means if two copies of the same vertex exist, both expected to have the same normals but connected to different
faces, Blender will calculate different normals for them.
Vertex fusion also makes it easier to manipulate vertices in the Blender GUI.

Our solution is Vertex Fusion, where before loading the model into Blender we examine the vertex buffers, decide on 
which vertices are logically equivalent, and "fuse" them into a single Blender-land vertex.
Blender stores most data (e.g. UVs) per-face-corner, so two vertices X,Y with different UVs can still be fused as long
as any face corners that originally referenced X use X's UV, and corners that referenced Y use Y's UV.
This (hopefully) creates a Blender mesh that is very similar to the source meshes the developers created for the game.

## Fusion
The first pass of vertex fusion is simple, using a heuristic of strict equality over (position, normal, boneweights)
to determine which vertices are equivalent (or "adjacent", to borrow a term from graph theory).
Adjacent vertices are fused into a single vertex, and all other vertices are untouched.
This heuristic is not perfect, though - it can over-fuse vertices to the point of losing data.

## Motivation - Unfusion
Consider two triangles ABC and DEF, where each vertex in ABC has an adjacent vertex in DEF.

    A
  B---C
  | | |  
  | D | 
  E---F

After the first pass of vertex fusion, each vertex of ABC will be fused with a vertex in DEF.
We can represent the resulting fused vertices as 
  - A,D -> X
  - B,E -> Y
  - C,F -> Z
ABC and DEF can be referred to as "fully-fused duplicates" - each vertex is the result of a fusion, and after fusion
they map to the same triangle XYZ.
Blender does not allow two triangles to exist between the same vertices.
There are two triangles worth of per-face-corner data to represent in ABC and DEF, which cannot be fully represented 
in the single triangle XYZ, so half the data will be lost after this fusion.
The solution? *Un*fuse some/all of those vertices to create two triangles XYZ and XYW, or XYZ and UVW, which can 
hold all of the per-face-corner data, while keeping as many vertices fused as possible to maintain correct normal data.

## Implementation
This process is implemented in four stages, with a fifth function combining the stages.

1. fuse_adjacent_vertices() does the first-pass fusion, deciding which vertices are adjacent and fusing them.
2. detect_fully_fused_triangles() builds a mapping of (fused tri) -> [(constituent pre-fusion tris)]
3. decide_on_unfusions() examines that mapping and decides which pairs of vertices should be *unfused* to resolve them
4. solve_unfusion() applies those unfusions to the previous first-pass fusion to decide on the final fusions.

vertex_fusion() applies stages 1 and 2, and if any fully-fused-duplicate-triangles are found it then applies 3 and 4.

See each function's documentation for details on each step.
decide_on_unfusions() has a comprehensive explanation of how it decides which vertices to unfuse.

    # is overlaid - the vertices on the "outside" of the copy can still be fused, and we want to fuse as many
    # as possible so that the output normals are most accurate.
    # Consider this triangle strip with an overlaid subset:
    #      ---A---E
    #     B-----C---F
    #     |   | | | |
    #  -X-|---A'|-E'|

    #    {ABC, A'B'C'},  {ACE, A'C'E'},  {CEF, C'E'F'}.
    # We *could* unfuse all the vertices from their counterparts,
    # but it is more ideal to keep A/A' and B/B' fused for the sake of normals.
    #
    # Here A' and B' are "exterior" vertices while the others are "interior".
    # We define this relationship by whether the vertices are connected to other not-fully-fused-dupe-triangles.
    # This is based on the fact that those other triangles may change the normals of the vertices A, B.
    # If vertices X and Y were not present, clearly A'/B' will have the same normals as A/B even if they aren't fused.
    #
    # So! We need to come up with an algorithm that unfuses C/C', E/E', F/F', but *not* A/A' and B/B'.
    # We also need to make sure this algorithm doesn't unfuse intra-layer split vertices.
    # Consider the case if we add a vertex D:
    #      ---A---E
    #     B-----CD--F
    #     |   | | | |
    #  -X-|---A'|-E'|
    # Y---B'----C'--F'
    # Here the triangles are (ignoring XY) ABC, ACE, DEF, A'B'C', A'C'E', C'E'F'.
    # We should keep C and D merged, but the algorithm should still decide to unfuse C/C' AND D/C'.
    #
    # We handle these problem by considering unfusions per-fully-fused-dupe-triangle.
    #
    #       --A     A---E     E
    #     B-----C   | C |   D---F
    #     | --A'|   A'|-E'  | E'|
    #     B'----C'    C'    C'--F'
    #
    # For ABC/A'B'C', we know that A' and B' are exterior, so we don't unfuse A/A', B/B' and just unfuse C from C'.
    # For ACE/A'C'E', we know that A' is exterior, so we don't unfuse A/A' but do unfuse C/C' and E/E'.
    # For DEF/C'E'F', there are no exterior vertices, so we unfuse all of D/C', E/E', F/F'.
    # The result is unfusing C/C', D/C', E/E', F/F', which is exactly what we want.
    #
    # Also, if we ever have a situation where all vertices are exterior:
    #      --G--
    #     H-----I
    #   x-|--G'-|-x
    # x---H'----I'-x
    # We unfuse all of them. Technically you could choose to unfuse one, but then we'd have to decide which one.
